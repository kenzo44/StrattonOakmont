# Stratton Oakmont

A mobile application with a user experience that reflects the prompt you selected - "Chance"

While developing something with "gambling" was the obvious choice from the beginning...

Instead, I built the app around stock trading which is sort of gambling but a little differ - exactly like gambling.

This app is very basic and needs a massive backend overhaul, including cleaning up the api calls which sometimes result in an error when the page is refreshed.

Features and Credits:

- Using https://www.alphavantage.co/ to retrieve live and accurate stock data
- Welcome/tutorial screen. Credits - https://github.com/valnub/welcomescreen.js

Had to end this at commit #21.
